# MagiGlyphs™   <img src="./icon/MagiGlyphs_x48.png" alt="MagiGlyphs Icon" align="left">
The MagiGlyphs™ project aims at creating a free mobile game.


## Gameplay
The game play focusses on matching up three of the same magical glyphs (color & shape) in a line to activate a spell, either to attack or to build up defenses.

The game play mechanic might look familiar.
I am a gamer myself, and of course I am influenced by the games I played and that I liked.
So, if you think this is similar to another game you know, than that game is likely awesome!


## Licensing
This game shall contain no ads, no payment whatsoever.
I build this project in my spare time as a hobby, and I will cover all necessary invests out of my own pockets.
My goal is to create a little game, that I want to play once in a while (e.g. waiting for a bus, and stuff).
